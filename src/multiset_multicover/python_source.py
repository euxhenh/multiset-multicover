    Creates a greedy cover instance. It can accept multisets and run
    the greedy cover algorithm. The coverage factor can be a single integer
    or a specific integer for each element.

    Examples
    ________
      >>> import multiset_multicover as mm

      >>> gci = mm.GreedyCoverInstance(4)
      >>> gci.add_multiset([1, 2, 3])  # if no multiplicity provided, it defaults to 1
      >>> gci.add_multiset([0, 1, 2], multiplicity=[2, 3, 1])
      >>> gci.add_multiset([0, 1, 2, 3])

      >>> gci.cover(1)
      Output: [2]
      >>> gci.cover([2, 1, 1, 1])
